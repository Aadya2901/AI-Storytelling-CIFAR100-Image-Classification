# AI Storytelling: CIFAR-100 Image Classification  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project applies **Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques** to the **CIFAR-100 dataset**, a challenging benchmark of 60,000 color images across 100 classes.  
We build and compare two models â€” an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** â€” to analyze how architecture choice impacts performance in image classification tasks.  

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights from Analysis  
- **Dataset**: 60,000 images (32Ã—32 pixels, 3 channels), 100 balanced classes  
- **Preprocessing**: Normalization and one-hot encoding applied  
- **Model Comparison**:  
  - **ANN** (flattened pixel input): Accuracy ~20â€“30%  
  - **CNN** (spatial feature extraction): Accuracy ~40â€“60%+  
- **Visualization**: Training curves, confusion matrix (sampled), and prediction examples  
- **Takeaway**: CNNs significantly outperform ANNs on image datasets by leveraging spatial patterns (edges, textures, shapes).  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

## ðŸ”® Next Steps  
Future improvements and extensions could include:  
- **Data Augmentation** (rotations, flips, shifts) to improve CNN generalization  
- **Transfer Learning** with pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG for higher accuracy  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** (filters, kernel size, dropout, optimizers) for performance optimization  
- **Explainable AI** methods (e.g., Grad-CAM) to visualize what the CNN focuses on in images
